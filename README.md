# 🌐 Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematics — Master Index  
**Repository:** Shunyaya-Symbolic-Mathematics-Master-Docs

This repository is the single entry point for the Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematics ecosystem.  
It links every active public project so that engineers, scientists, regulators, and partners can navigate the full framework without needing private context.

All projects below share one core principle:  
express reality as a symbolic, auditable, bounded signal — stable across vendors, borders, and time.

**Update (Nov 2025).**  
Recent updates in the Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematics ecosystem strengthen three key pillars: data exchange, networks, and electrical systems.

- **SSMDE** establishes a way for semantics to travel as *policy manifests* instead of brittle global dictionaries.  
  Values remain byte-for-byte identical; duty travels separately as `align`, `band`, and `manifest_id`.  
  This allows transparent data exchange between machines without breaking schemas or protocols.

- **SSM-NET** brings the same clarity to internet traffic.  
  Payloads stay unchanged (`phi((m,a)) = m`), while posture travels as a tiny, stamped declaration  
  (`sha256=<hex>`, `prev=<hex>`). Order, replay, and tampering become visible without rewriting TCP/HTTP.

- **SSMEQ** extends Shunyaya to electrical quantities.  
  Ordinary volts, amps, watts, and pf gain expressive zero-centric contrasts (`e_V`, `e_I`, `e_f`, `e_P`) and  
  a power residual `r_P` that can highlight wiring issues, load drift, and hidden instability.  
  Optional canonical subset commitments and continuity stamps make plant/grid timelines replayable without  
  touching existing meters or SCADA.

Together, these standards form a base layer for manifest-based, verifiable infrastructure — keeping raw reality unchanged while adding a small symbolic lane beside it.

🌟 AIM — A tiny, 108 KB, manifest-first Personal AI (upcoming)  
Documented in the Shunyaya blogs and scheduled for GitHub release. AIM runs locally, is lightweight and self-contained, and stamps each result for reproducibility. It is designed to sit beside universal AI systems as a manifest-based, verifiable companion — keeping personal context, stamps, and audit trails under the user’s control, even when large cloud models perform heavier computation.

### 🧾 Historical / Legacy Lineage
- Zentrube — Shunyaya Entropy Framework: Time-Aware Entropy That Works  
  Zentrube was an early public demonstration that entropy can be tracked as a live, numeric signal over time, using bounded drift instead of raw instability.  
  It successfully proved the idea that “system health” can be monitored symbolically without rewriting the underlying physics or KPIs.

  Status: Zentrube has now been superseded by the unified Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematics approach — including Zeozo, Syasys / Unified Framework direction, and the formal SSM lane model (`x := (m,a)` with `phi((m,a)) = m`).  
  In other words: Zentrube was the proof of possibility, but the ongoing work lives in the active repositories listed above.

---

## 🔹 Shared Structure Across All Repositories
Every Shunyaya repository follows a common pattern:
- `README.md` — purpose and surface-level value
- `GETTING_STARTED.txt` — 2-minute onboarding
- `CALIBRATION.txt` — safe knob tuning and policy defaults
- Public spec PDFs (brief and full)
- Manifest and checksum patterns for traceability

This consistency makes the math auditable, the deployments reproducible, and the results defensible.

## Semantic Category / Practical Scope

- **Domains:** AI alignment, network observability, data provenance, governance frameworks, safety dials, operational assurance.
- **Integration surfaces:** HTTP / MQTT / Kafka / REST / streaming telemetry / embedded message buses.
- **Implementation footprint:** Works in Python, Rust, Go, C, and browser JavaScript; no vendor dependencies; no protocol rewrites.

## 🔹 License / Usage

**Ecosystem policy**  
- Each repository declares its own license and usage notes in its `README.md`.  
- **Open-standard repos (e.g., SSMDE, SSMT, SSM-NET, SSMEQ)** are free to implement with **no registration or fees**, provided formulas and stamps are implemented exactly as declared in a published manifest and any changes are clearly documented.  
- Unless otherwise stated in a specific repo, narrative documents, examples, and site content across the ecosystem are released under **Creative Commons BY-NC 4.0** (attribution, non-commercial, observation-only). No warranty. No endorsement or affiliation implied.

**Attribution requirement**  
- When implementing or adapting, cite the concept name of the relevant standard, e.g.:

  - **“Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematical Data Exchange (SSMDE)”**  
  - **“Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematical Temperature (SSMT)”**  
  - **“Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematical Network (SSM-NET)”**

**Safety**  
- All Shunyaya materials are **observation-only** scaffolds intended to aid governance, auditability, and reproducibility.  
  Do not use as the sole gate in life-critical systems without independent verification and domain-appropriate redundancies.

This `Shunyaya-Symbolic-Mathematics-Master-Docs` repository is an index and navigation layer. It does not grant exclusivity or stewardship over any domain; it exists to make the work visible, auditable, and useful to humanity.
