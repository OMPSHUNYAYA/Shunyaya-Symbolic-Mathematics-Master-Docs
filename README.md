# 🌐 Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematics — Master Index  
**Repository:** Shunyaya-Symbolic-Mathematics-Master-Docs

This repository is the single entry point for the Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematics ecosystem.  
It links every active public project so that engineers, scientists, regulators, and partners can navigate the full framework without needing private context.

All projects below share one core principle:  
express reality as a symbolic, auditable, bounded signal — stable across vendors, borders, and time.

**Update (Nov 2025).** With SSMDE, semantics travel as *policy manifests* — not as brittle, global dictionaries. This unlocks Personal AI (edge emitters that keep `m` byte-for-byte, add a tiny lane, and stamp each claim) and Universal AI (cloud readers that route/audit by bands). It’s a clean path to empowering every human with a verifiable, portable AI—without rewiring existing models. Full playbooks land in the upcoming SSM-AI update.

### 🔁 Data Exchange & Governance
- [Symbolic-Mathematical-Data-Exchange (SSMDE)](https://github.com/OMPSHUNYAYA/Symbolic-Mathematical-Data-Exchange)  
  Portable declarations of truth for machine-to-machine exchange. Each record carries `value`, bounded `align`, policy `band`, `manifest_id`, and a tamper-evident `stamp` — order-invariant fusion, manifest-locked policy, observation-only.

---

### 🌡 Temperature & Environmental Stability
- [Symbolic-Mathematical-Temperature (SSMT)](https://github.com/OMPSHUNYAYA/Symbolic-Mathematical-Temperature)  
  Open standard for temperature as a portable, auditable signal — unitless contrast `e_T` and bounded phase dials instead of raw °C/°F. Observation-only. No registration or fees. Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematical Temperature (SSMT).

---

### 🧠 Intelligence & AI
- [Symbolic-Mathematical-AI (SSM-AI)](https://github.com/OMPSHUNYAYA/Symbolic-Mathematical-AI)  
  Alignment lane beside classical AI scores. Bounded, auditable, reproducible.

- [Zeozo — y = m*x + c, redefined](https://github.com/OMPSHUNYAYA/Zeozo)  
  Reinterpreting linearity, offset, and slope under Shunyaya’s symbolic view of zero.

- [Symbolic-Mathematics-0over0-Limits](https://github.com/OMPSHUNYAYA/Symbolic-Mathematics-0over0-Limits)  
  Formal treatment of `0/0` and undefined forms using Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematics (SSM) and Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematical Symbols (SSMS).

### 🧾 Historical / Legacy Lineage
- Zentrube — Shunyaya Entropy Framework: Time-Aware Entropy That Works  
  Zentrube was an early public demonstration that entropy can be tracked as a live, numeric signal over time, using bounded drift instead of raw instability.  
  It successfully proved the idea that “system health” can be monitored symbolically without rewriting the underlying physics or KPIs.

  Status: Zentrube has now been superseded by the unified Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematics approach — including Zeozo, Syasys / Unified Framework direction, and the formal SSM lane model (`x := (m,a)` with `phi((m,a)) = m`).  
  In other words: Zentrube was the proof of possibility, but the ongoing work lives in the active repositories listed above.

## 🔹 Future Extensions
These projects are in advanced preparation and will appear in this index once published:

- SSM-Fin — symbolic finance lenses for portfolio, credit, and risk.
- SSM-Cyber — bounded drift lenses for traffic/IDS and security analytics.
- SSM-Health — physiological signals with symbolic stability lanes.
- SSM-Climate — multi-scale environmental stability and early-warning dials.

Additional domain adapters in safety, infrastructure, and planetary systems are in active pipeline.

## 🔹 Shared Structure Across All Repositories
Every Shunyaya repository follows a common pattern:
- `README.md` — purpose and surface-level value
- `GETTING_STARTED.txt` — 2-minute onboarding
- `CALIBRATION.txt` — safe knob tuning and policy defaults
- Public spec PDFs (brief and full)
- Manifest and checksum patterns for traceability

This consistency makes the math auditable, the deployments reproducible, and the results defensible.

## 🔹 License / Usage

**Ecosystem policy**
- Each repository declares its own license and usage notes in its `README.md`.
- Open-standard repos (e.g., **SSMDE**, **SSMT**) are free to implement with **no registration or fees**, provided formulas and stamps are implemented exactly as declared in a published manifest and changes are clearly documented.
- Unless otherwise stated in a specific repo, narrative documents, examples, and site content across the ecosystem are released under **Creative Commons BY-NC 4.0** (attribution, non-commercial, observation-only). No warranty. No endorsement or affiliation implied.

**Attribution requirement**
- When implementing or adapting, cite the concept name of the relevant standard, e.g.  
  **“Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematical Data Exchange (SSMDE)”**,  
  **“Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematical Temperature (SSMT)”**.

**Safety**
- All Shunyaya materials are **observation-only** scaffolds intended to aid governance, auditability, and reproducibility.  
  Do not use as the sole gate in life-critical systems without independent verification and domain-appropriate redundancies.

This `Shunyaya-Symbolic-Mathematics-Master-Docs` repository is an index and navigation layer. It does not grant exclusivity or stewardship over any domain; it exists to make the work visible, auditable, and useful to humanity.
