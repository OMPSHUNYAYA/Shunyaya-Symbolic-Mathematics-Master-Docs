# 🌐 Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematics — Master Index  
**Repository:** Shunyaya-Symbolic-Mathematics-Master-Docs

This repository is the single entry point for the Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematics ecosystem.  
It links every active public project so that engineers, scientists, regulators, and partners can navigate the full framework without needing private context.

All projects below share one core principle:  
express reality as a symbolic, auditable, bounded signal — stable across vendors, borders, and time.

### 🟢 Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematical Law (Law 0)

**“Every classical value carries a bounded alignment lane, revealing reality drift and stability while retaining the original number.”**

Law 0 defines the core two-lane structure used across all Shunyaya systems:

### 🔬 Scientific Proof-of-Concepts (Popular Laws Enhanced by SSM)

- **Bounded Classical Laws — Proof of Concept**  
  10 foundational physics and engineering laws (Ohm, Hooke, Bernoulli, Ideal Gas, Faraday, Continuity, Snell, Momentum, etc.) expressed in two parallel tracks:  
  **(1)** Classical calculation (`F = kx`, `V = IR`, etc.) and  
  **(2)** Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematics beside it, adding a bounded alignment lane `a ∈ (-1,+1)` that reveals stability, drift, and hidden posture (`phi((m,a)) = m`).  
  Includes 10 scripts with CI-backed execution and “Getting Started” walkthroughs.

### 🔁 Data Exchange & Governance
- [Symbolic-Mathematical-Data-Exchange (SSMDE)](https://github.com/OMPSHUNYAYA/Symbolic-Mathematical-Data-Exchange)  
  Portable declarations of truth for machine-to-machine exchange. Each record carries `value`, bounded `align`, policy `band`, `manifest_id`, and a tamper-evident `stamp` — order-invariant fusion, manifest-locked policy, observation-only.

---

  ### 🌐 Networking & Internet Overlay
- [Symbolic-Mathematical-Network (SSM-NET)](https://github.com/OMPSHUNYAYA/Symbolic-Mathematical-Network)  
  A manifest-first overlay beside existing traffic: keep payload bytes unchanged (`phi((m,a)) = m`), declare posture as `band`, commit a canonical subset `sha256=<hex>`, and link events with a portable continuity stamp `SSMCLOCK1|<iso_utc>|nonce=<...>|sha256=<...>|prev=<...>`. Observation-only; policy lives in published manifests.

### 🌡 Temperature & Environmental Stability
- [Symbolic-Mathematical-Temperature (SSMT)](https://github.com/OMPSHUNYAYA/Symbolic-Mathematical-Temperature)

- [Symbolic-Mathematical-Electrical-Quantities (SSMEQ)](https://github.com/OMPSHUNYAYA/Symbolic-Mathematical-Electrical-Quantities)  
  Zero-centric electrical overlay for volts, amps, watts, and power-factor. Keeps raw measurements intact (`phi((m,a)) = m`) and adds symbolic contrasts (`e_V`, `e_I`, `e_f`, `e_P`), a power residual `r_P`, and band logic `band_P` under manifest control. Optional canonical subset commitments (`sha256=<hex>`) and continuity stamps (`SSMCLOCK1|<iso_utc>|nonce=<...>|sha256=<...>|prev=<...>`) make plant and grid timelines replayable without changing existing meters, SCADA, or protocols.

### 🧾 Historical / Legacy Lineage
- Zentrube — Shunyaya Entropy Framework: Time-Aware Entropy That Works  
  Zentrube was an early public demonstration that entropy can be tracked as a live, numeric signal over time, using bounded drift instead of raw instability.  
  It successfully proved the idea that “system health” can be monitored symbolically without rewriting the underlying physics or KPIs.

  Status: Zentrube has now been superseded by the unified Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematics approach — including Zeozo, Syasys / Unified Framework direction, and the formal SSM lane model (`x := (m,a)` with `phi((m,a)) = m`).  
  In other words: Zentrube was the proof of possibility, but the ongoing work lives in the active repositories listed above.

  Central map of the ecosystem. Use this link in future to re-establish full project context.

## 🔹 Future Extensions
These projects are in advanced preparation and will appear in this index once published:

- SSM-Fin — symbolic finance lenses for portfolio, credit, and risk.
- SSM-Cyber — bounded drift lenses for traffic/IDS and security analytics.
- SSM-Health — physiological signals with symbolic stability lanes.
- SSM-Climate — multi-scale environmental stability and early-warning dials.

Additional domain adapters in safety, infrastructure, and planetary systems are in active pipeline.

---

## 🔹 Shared Structure Across All Repositories
Every Shunyaya repository follows a common pattern:
- `README.md` — purpose and surface-level value
- `GETTING_STARTED.txt` — 2-minute onboarding
- `CALIBRATION.txt` — safe knob tuning and policy defaults
- Public spec PDFs (brief and full)
- Manifest and checksum patterns for traceability

This consistency makes the math auditable, the deployments reproducible, and the results defensible.

---

## Semantic Category / Practical Scope

- **Domains:** AI alignment, network observability, data provenance, governance frameworks, safety dials, operational assurance.
- **Integration surfaces:** HTTP / MQTT / Kafka / REST / streaming telemetry / embedded message buses.
- **Implementation footprint:** Works in Python, Rust, Go, C, and browser JavaScript; no vendor dependencies; no protocol rewrites.

---

## 🔹 License / Usage

**Ecosystem policy**  
- Each repository declares its own license and usage notes in its `README.md`.  

- **Open-standard projects (SSMDE, SSMT, SSM-NET, SSMEQ, SSM-ClockKe, SSM-AIM Mini)** are free to implement with **no registration or fees**, provided formulas and stamps are implemented exactly as declared in a published manifest and any changes are clearly documented. Open-standard projects are still research frameworks — they simply offer more permissive, implementation-friendly terms.

- **All other Shunyaya standards remain research frameworks released under CC BY-NC 4.0.**  
  Their *documents, examples, and site text* are CC BY-NC 4.0, and the standards themselves are not licensed for commercial use or exclusive stewardship.

- Unless explicitly marked otherwise in a repo, narrative material across the ecosystem follows **CC BY-NC 4.0**.  
  No warranty. No endorsement or affiliation implied.

**Attribution requirement**  
- When implementing or adapting, cite the concept name of the relevant standard, e.g.:

  - **“Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematical Data Exchange (SSMDE)”**  
  - **“Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematical Temperature (SSMT)”**  
  - **“Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematical Network (SSM-NET)”**  
  - **“Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematical Electrical Quantities (SSMEQ)”**  
  - **“Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematical Clock Kernel (SSM-ClockKe)”**
  
**Safety**  
- All Shunyaya materials are **observation-only** scaffolds intended to aid governance, auditability, and reproducibility.  
  Do not use as the sole gate in life-critical systems without independent verification and domain-appropriate redundancies.

This `Shunyaya-Symbolic-Mathematics-Master-Docs` repository is an index and navigation layer. It does not grant exclusivity or stewardship over any domain; it exists to make the work visible, auditable, and useful to humanity.
