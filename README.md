# 🌐 Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematics — Master Index  
**Repository:** Shunyaya-Symbolic-Mathematics-Master-Docs

This repository is the single entry point for the Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematics ecosystem.  
It links every active public project so that engineers, scientists, regulators, and partners can navigate the full framework without needing private context.

All projects below share one core principle:  
express reality as a symbolic, auditable, bounded signal — stable across vendors, borders, and time.

### 📐 Conceptual & Theoretical Extensions
- [Zeozo — y = m x + c, redefined](https://github.com/OMPSHUNYAYA/Zeozo)  
  Reinterpreting linearity, offset, and slope under Shunyaya’s symbolic view of zero.

- [Symbolic-Mathematics-0over0-Limits](https://github.com/OMPSHUNYAYA/Symbolic-Mathematics-0over0-Limits)  
  Formal treatment of `0/0` and undefined forms using Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematics (SSM) and Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematical Symbols (SSMS).

### 🧾 Historical / Legacy Lineage
- Zentrube — Shunyaya Entropy Framework: Time-Aware Entropy That Works  
  Zentrube was an early public demonstration that entropy can be tracked as a live, numeric signal over time, using bounded drift instead of raw instability.  
  It successfully proved the idea that “system health” can be monitored symbolically without rewriting the underlying physics or KPIs.

  Status: Zentrube has now been superseded by the unified Shunyaya Symbolic Mathematics approach — including Zeozo, Syasys / Unified Framework direction, and the formal SSM lane model (`x := (m,a)` with `phi((m,a)) = m`).  
  In other words: Zentrube was the proof of possibility, but the ongoing work lives in the active repositories listed above.

## 🔹 Future Extensions
These projects are in advanced preparation and will appear in this index once published:
- Symbolic-Mathematical-Temperature (SSMT) — zero-centric temperature as a universal, auditable signal.
- Symbolic-Mathematical-DataExchange (SSMDE) — portable, manifest-anchored machine-to-machine data interchange.

In addition, domain adapters such as SSM-Fin, SSM-Cyber, SSM-Health, and SSM-Climate — along with others in safety, infrastructure, and planetary systems — are in active pipeline.

---

## 🔹 Shared Structure Across All Repositories
Every Shunyaya repository follows a common pattern:
- `README.md` — purpose and surface-level value
- `GETTING_STARTED.txt` — 2-minute onboarding
- `CALIBRATION.txt` — safe knob tuning and policy defaults
- Public spec PDFs (brief and full)
- Manifest and checksum patterns for traceability

This consistency makes the math auditable, the deployments reproducible, and the results defensible.
